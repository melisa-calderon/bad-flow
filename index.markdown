## Project Description
For this project, I utilized the Spotify API to collect  the top tracks for the artist Doja Cat. Then, I saved this information to a database, so the data I wanted saved is easily available. Finally, I created a sunburst graph to display the 'Percentage of the Popularity of the Top 10 Tracks of Doja Cat'. 

## Technology/Languages Used
