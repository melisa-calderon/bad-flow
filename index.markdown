## Project Description
For this project, I utilized the Spotify API to collect  the top tracks for the artist Doja Cat. 
Then, I saved this information to a database, so the data I wanted saved is easily available. 
Finally, I created a graph displaying the amount of the top 10 tracks that are explicit. 

## Technology/Languages Used

* Python to code program
* MYSQL for database
* Spotify API to access necessary data
* MATLAB for graphing
